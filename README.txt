5. Explain your answers (18 points)

Please answer the following questions for each file you wrote as part of this assignment.

1. Making change
"Why This Works" Explanation: Explain the underlying logic and reasoning that makes your code solve the problem. 
Focus on the core concepts and principles your solution utilizes.

It works because I use recursion to get the number of combination there are. If the amount 
wanted is 0, that mean there is only 1 way to combine it. If the amount is less than 0, there 
is 0 way of making it. It the maxCoin is 1, then it will recurse with the same value except 
the amount will be subtracted by the number that I can use. If the maxCoin is more than 1, 
then it will recurses with adding both the (amount - maxCoins) number and the amount with 
the (maxCoins - 1) value.


2. Frequency of leading digits

3. Multiplying matrices
"Why This Works" Explanation: Explain the underlying logic and reasoning that makes your code solve the problem. 
Focus on the core concepts and principles your solution utilizes.

This works because I use a for loop to read all the numbers from the input. Then, I used a 
base statement saying that if the number of columns of matrix a is not the same as the number 
of rows of matrix b is, then the function will not work and return false (-1). But for those 
that pass the case, it will do matrix multiplication. It has 3 nested for loop to loop through the 
row and columns of the matrix c and the inner most for loop is to loop through the columns 
of matrix a and rows of matrix b to multiple them together to get matrix c. Then, at the end, 
I used for loop to loop through matrix a, b, and c to print out the numbers in the matrix.
