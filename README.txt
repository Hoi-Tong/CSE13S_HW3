1. Reversing an array using pointers.
"Why This Works" Explanation: Explain the underlying logic and reasoning that makes your code solve the problem. 
Focus on the core concepts and principles your solution utilizes.

It works because i used the two pointer method to reverse the numbers. First, I get another pointer 
called "right_arr" point to the end of the array of numbers. Then, I use a while loop to keep 
looping as long as arr is less than right_arr. Then, I create another int variable called "temp" 
to help me swap the numbers that the two pointer are pointing to. I assign the value *arr to temp, 
then *right_arr to *arr, then temp to *right_arr. Then, I add one to arr and substract one from 
right_arr to move the pointer. Then the while loop will keep looping as long as arr is smaller than 
right_arr.
